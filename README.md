### Abstract: 

Today agriculture is a key source of livelihood for around 50% of people in India. To bring positive growth in Indiaâ€™s GDP, modifications in the agriculture industry are required. Around 42% of the farm produce goes to waste due to the inability of farmers to detect and take precautions against plant leaf diseases. 

The primary source of income for the majority of people in India is agriculture. Due to the diverse climate all over India, a wide variety of crops are produced in India. The production of crops is affected by various factors such as climatic conditions, soil conditions, various diseases, etc. Currently, farmers rely on their eyes for detecting any plant disease which results in improper judgment and hampers the quality of the farm produce and, increases the amount of produce thrown in waste. Inefficient disease detection leads to improper pesticide usage that can cause the development of long-term resistance of the pathogens and resultantly reduces the ability of the crop to fight back. Plant leaf disease detection can be achieved by identifying various spots on the leaves of the affected plant. We are using a convolution neural network (CNN) along with image augmentation to detect plant leaf diseases.
